# A beam calculation website for mechanical engineering (in progress)

## Calculations:

- ✅<s>check if beam is statically determinate</s>
- ✅<s>calculate reactions in supports</s>
- add continuous loading
- graphs for forces and torques in the beam
- graphs after adding cont. loads
- allow hinges
- other graphs and calculations, like beam displacement
- statically indeterminate beams

### Other to do's:
- allow multiple items in one node
- errors in dom instead of alerts
- unify data in node objects (ex. 'fy' on both supports and forces); Split forces into fy/fx right after adding node
